### Client application

We used to ship a client app, based on Spring Petclinic, but we have a new and shiny new example app : the Fullstack demo.
It is available at : https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3-samples, in particular : https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3-samples/tree/master/fullstack

Of course, you can use any Java client application using EhCache 3.2.0 :

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.ehcache</groupId>
      <artifactId>ehcache</artifactId>
      <version>3.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
```
